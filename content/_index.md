## Features

- Weighs just 2.9kb minified and gzipped, with zero dependencies.
- Simple templating with JavaScript strings or template literals.
- Load it with a `<script>` element or ES module import&mdash;no command line or transpiling required (though you can if you want).
- Uses DOM diffing to update only the things that have changed.
- Has Redux/Vuex-like data stores, with setters and getters baked right in.
- Automatically sanitizes HTML before rendering to help protect you from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Work with native JavaScript methods and browser APIs instead of custom methods and pseudo-languages.
- Compatible with all modern browsers.

Ditch that bloated framework, and make web development fun and simple again!



## Why use Reef?

Reef is an anti-framework.

It does a lot less than the big guys like React and Vue. It doesn't have a Virtual DOM. It doesn't require you to learn a custom templating syntax. It doesn't provide a bunch of custom methods.

**Reef does just one thing: render UI.**

Couldn't you just use some template strings and `innerHTML`? Sure. But Reef only updates things that have changed instead of clobbering the DOM and removing focus from your form fields. It also automatically renders a new UI when your data updates, and helps protect you from XSS attacks.

If you're craving a simpler, back-to-basics web development experience, Reef is for you.

(*And if not, that's cool too! Carry on.*)
