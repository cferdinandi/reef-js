<h1 class="text-xlarge margin-bottom-small">Reef</h1>

<p class="text-large">A tiny utility library for building reactive state-based UI.</p>

Reef is a simpler alternative to React, Vue, and other UI libraries. No build steps. No fancy syntax. Just vanilla JS and a few small utility functions.

## Features

- Weighs just 2.6kb minified and gzipped, with zero dependencies.
- Simple templating with JavaScript strings or template literals.
- Load it with a `<script>` element or ES module import&mdash;no command line or transpiling required (though you can if you want).
- Uses DOM diffing to update only the things that have changed.
- Automatically sanitizes HTML before rendering to help protect you from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- Write vanilla JS, and use a few small utility methods only when they're needed.
- Compatible with all modern browsers.

Make web development fun and simple again!
