Reef includes two optional ways to handle URL/route management in your apps:

1. **[Router](/routing/router/)** for single-page apps.
2. **[Snorkel](/routing/snorkel/)** for speedier multi-page apps.

Both have been designed to integrate deeply with Reef, and share the same simple, lightweight approach.
